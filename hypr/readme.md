Most dotfiles in here are by JaKoolIt (linked on main readme). I modified some of these file to better fit my aethestic i.e. gaps.

I do not guarantee the dots will work on newer version of Hyprland.

# Structuring
I actually liked how Ja classified his dots into different folders and calling them on the main file. The main config file won't look like a mess.

If you need to modify autostart programs, edit the main file. Otherwise edit everything in UserConfigs.

You probably do not need to edit the other files though. Maybe you would, but as much as possible, please just keep it original.
