Readme are on rofi and hypr folder for better clarity since you won't understand a thing like I did.

# Scripts

ClipManager could be replaced by anything. I'm currently using nwg-clipman (for my Sway setup).

KeyHints could be replaced by [xwkh](https://github.com/imchocomint/xwkh).


My other (sway, i3wm, KDE Plasma) config files are at [a differrent repository](https://github.com/imchocomint/collection). Just click on branches to see.
