# dots
 Hyprland dots. Forked from JaKoolIt

This is my current dots on Debian 13/sid. Pretty much softwares are the folder names apart from cliphist, which is required for the clipboard history script; or swww and ags. You'll have to find a way to install them.

## Scripts
Scripts are at /hypr/scripts/. Most of them functions on their own. ClipManager could be replaced by anything. I'm currently using nwg-clipman (for my Sway setup)

Kitty_themes should be deleted since I'm currently using a single config file for the app (which is independent and don't relate to JaKoolIt config in anyway). The update script is also not recommended to use since at this point you're using a differrent config. The two NixOS files could be deleted if you're using any other OS.

KeyHints could be replaced by xwkh.

thanks I guess. My other config files are at [a differrent repository](https://github.com/imchocomint/collection).
