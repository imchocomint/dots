These config files, as well as the themes, are from JaKoolIt's config. Some of them are heavily modified by me. Credits are on each file.

There used to be 15 themes in /themes/. I picked whatever fits my aethestic, modify them (color, transparency, position,...) and delete the rest. Most themes spawns in bottom right of the screen (to save space and better clarity while multitasking).

The config.rasi file is actually a hub file interconnecting the themes with rofi. Just change the number of the theme if you want to change anything.

Colors are so terribly managed. You may have a hard time swallowing these up. You should not change the color indicators (at /wallust/) since it would break all the themes.
